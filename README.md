# 🌌 Ktorus – Build Your Own HTTP Server 🚀
Welcome to **Ktorus**, a lightweight HTTP server written in Kotlin! 

## 📚 About the Project
Ktorus is an HTTP server built to handle simple GET/POST requests, serve files, and manage multiple concurrent connections. Ktorus dives into the technical world of:

- 🌐 TCP Connections – the backbone of network communication
- 💌 HTTP Headers – learning what makes HTTP requests tick
- 🚦 HTTP Verbs – handling requests with methods like GET and POST
- 🔀 Concurrent Connections – so our server can handle multiple requests simultaneously
- 📁 File Serving – allowing our server to respond with files and other resources

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/fahaddahmed/Ktorus.git
cd Ktorus
```

## 🎉 Features
- Basic Request Handling – handles GET and POST requests seamlessly
- Concurrent Connections – capable of handling multiple users at once
- File Serving – responds with static files
- Learning Journey – a great way to learn about the fundamentals of HTTP servers and network programming

## 🌟 Future Goals
- 🕸️ Add More HTTP Methods – support for PUT, DELETE, and others
- 🔐 Enhanced Security – adding basic authentication
- 🚀 Performance Tuning – optimize the server for faster responses
